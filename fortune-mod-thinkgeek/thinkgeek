THE CASE OF THE MISSING COMMENTS

   It was a dark, foreboding night. The kind you only see in the movies 
(or the internet). A figure emerges from the shadows, short and slightly 
overweight. It was Professor Uber Geek, the well known Uzbekistanian 
Detective. He lifted his hat from his head and began to speak.
   "Trust me, my friends. The comments cannot be too far. It has only been 
a few minutes. To solve this mystery, we must first examine the scene of 
the crime: ThinkGeek.com."
   Upon arriving at the local CyberCafe and spending nearly four hours at 
ThinkGeek.com (most of which was probably spent shopping), Professor Geek 
was determined that the culprits are a clever league of monkeys and cows.
   His logic was later mapped out in a well known poster, "The Case Of The 
Missing Comments: An Examination (Movie 1 of 12): The Clever Office 
Poster". 
   It looked something like this:

              THE CASE OF THE MISSING COMMENTS
                       AN EXAMINATION
                         THE MOVIE
                 
                    (picture of Uber Geek)

Clue 1: comments are submitted to ThinkGeek initially.

Clue 2: as far as I can tell, there are no third parties involved,
namely, Microsoft or RedHat or Intel or AMD.

Clue 3: as soon as a comment is submitted, it is never seen by it's    
original creator, however:

Clue 4: everyone seems to be able to the quote.

Theory 1: A futuristic invisible-cookie system, so ThinkGeek.com will know 
who is accessing their Customer Fortune page and filter it appropriatly.

Theory 2: The ThinkGeek staff is holding all the comments hostage, while 
formulating their own comments, and laughing as they monitor the usage 
stats for \fortune.shtml.

Theory 3: Somehow, a league of cows and monkeys was involved in the 
kidnapping of the comments and brainwashing of the ThinkGeek staff. It is 
the comments of the clever monkeys and cows that we see.

              Personally, I'm electing theory 3.

"Once upon a time there was a monkey that loved to eat cheese and drink 
bawls... 

while writing Japanese poetry and contemplating the origin of the 
universe. In a particularly intense moment of enlightenment, he realized 
that he was wearing a garter belt and high-heels. He found this puzzling 
because he distinctly remembered donning a pair of overalls and a atraw 
hat earlier in the day. This caused him to further contemplate... 

why the traffic outside all seemed to be frozen in time. Even the exhaust 
of the cars were suspended in air. The monkey scratched his... 

cranium in a perplexed gesture of helplessness peculiar to the primate 
family, and set off down the sidewalk. Unfortunately, he was in Trenton, 
New Jersey and it was 3AM, so before he got too far he was accosted by a 
masked man with a pistol, who demanded his high heels and garter belt from 
him. Undaunted, our fearless simian hero declared... 

himself a coder god and inisisted that the masked man bow before him and 
assert his status as a "1337 h4x0r". Lauging, the masked man drew his 
pistol, and muttering something under his breath about the "damn script 
kiddies taking over" he... 

suddenly began to convulse after a television set in a nearby store aired 
the episode of pokemon that sent all those japanese children into the 
hospital. The lucky monkey, who had been born colorblind, simply walked 
away and pulled the garter belt out of his A55K&reg;@pK (which it had 
begun to ride up) when he suddenly noticed... 

He was magicly transformed in to a unix admin. Having gained 300 pounds 
and now bearly able to move he took a long slow breath, he sighed and 
thought...

My cat's name is mittens." 

That is kind of crazy cause my late cat was named Mittens. But she got hit 
by a car. Mittens is a really unique name so I'm curious 
as to why he chose it. Maybe it was actually myself in a previous 
lifetime. 

This is weird - I too used to know a cat called Mittens, because it had 9 
toes on each front foot. 

this is weird because i had a cat called mittens that got killed, and 
because i was young and impressionable, ever since then i have kidnapp any 
cat i ever saw called mittens.

now i call all my cats "monkey tailed wak-wak hubba acid lover", now thats

"Once upon a time there was a monkey that loved to eat cheese and drink

while writing Japanese poetry and contemplating the origin of the

..."ive got a 6-pack of bawls here and i know how to use it!!!" the man 
had never heard of bawls and ordered the monkey once again to part with 
his strange attire, so the monkey opened all 6 of the bottles and drank 
them in one gulp, the bawls traveled through his system and directly into 
his brain stem. and then...  
 
he called forth a demon like no other. The demon was no standard demon, 
for the demonic features were not visible upon this demon. This demon was 
sporting large, undemonic dental fixtures that constantly rearranged 
themselves. The strange man wondered out loud, why is the demon wearing 
undemon dental fixtures, when demons don't need them? The demon answered I 
am the evil demon of dentistry that sucks the usage of quotations in 
sentences. The demon finished its sentence quickly, as the large and 
atroscious fixtures rearranged themselves in its left nostril. The demon 
laughed and told the stranger Say good bye to your nitrogen bases! and as 
the demon said this, the undemonic dental fixtures attracted a lightning 
bolt that was passing by. The demon died, the monkey sighed, the story was 
over, and everyone else got a pretty cat.

Bureau of Furniture and Bedding has been suppressing information from you 
about monkies and thus endangering the welfare of geeks.

In November 1985, shortly before the release of Windows 1.0, George W. 
Bush met with Bill Gates in Redmond to discuss software piracy. As it 
happens, they engaged in illegal bargaining and ended up hatching a plan 
involving the American Medical Association in Iceland.

As a result, all details of the meeting were suppressed, as was 
information about dealings with Microsoft and their ties to jaywalking.

A report in Slashdot was mysteriously pulled from newsstands in April of 
last year. The article implicated high-ranking officials in Motion Picture 
Association of America, various programmers, and, perhaps not 
surprisingly, Larry Ellison. According to the report, passages in the book 
"A New Kind of Science" and lyrics in They Might Be Giants's music point 
to a connection between these individuals and monkies.

According to a spokesman at Slashdot, the issue was pulled because of 
printing errors. However, individuals who saw the original copies say that 
there were no printing irregularities and that the re-issue differed from 
the original only in the absence of this article.

The lies and deception must be stopped. Don't let the government hide the 
facts about monkies any longer. Learn the truth!

With one million dollars and free shipping, you can buy one of each 
ThinkGeek t-shirt (unisex, size medium, to be specific) and 38424.678 
cases of Bawls. That's 922192.283 bottles of Bawls, and if you drink 12 
bottles a day, they would last for 76849.357 days, which is roughly 
210.402 years, enough for you and 2.057 of your geeky friends to be fully 
caffeinated for 70 years. If you know anyone with a million dollars, it's 
a good idea to be nice to them. Unless you already have a million dollars, 
then you're all set.

"Once upon a time there was a monkey that loved to eat cheese and drink 
bawls...

while writing Japanese poetry and contemplating the origin of the 
universe. In a particularly intense moment of enlightenment, he realized 
that he was wearing a garter belt and high-heels. He found this puzzling 
because he distinctly remembered donning a pair of overalls and a atraw 
hat earlier in the day. This caused him to further contemplate...

why the traffic outside all seemed to be frozen in time. Even the exhaust 
of the cars were suspended in air. The monkey scratched his...

cranium in a perplexed gesture of helplessness peculiar to the primate 
family, and set off down the sidewalk. Unfortunately, he was in Trenton, 
New Jersey and it was 3AM, so before he got too far he was accosted by a 
masked man with a pistol, who demanded his high heels and garter belt from 
him. Undaunted, our fearless simian hero declared...

Ok, so I'm not a geek; I'm forbidden from approaching my girlfriend's 
computer setup. Everytime I've been near it there have been glitches, BSOD 
crashes, hardware failures, and on one occasion a monitor explosion (as in 
'bang, spark, burn, melted plastic and smoke, and I was only looking over 
her shoulder). What can I say?: I'm infected with gremlins. She thinks 
that I'm nature's way of ensuring that computers never take over the 
world: if they try, you just have to put me in front of a keyboard. This 
is unfair as I build my own computers and they work just fine. Admittedly 
every time I walk into the computer lab at university something goes 
wrong, but surely that's just coincidence? So I'm not a geek, just a

I shall us this as an outlet for my movie and TV show ideas as well as 
commercials.

1# (movie) its about a guy who fell into a coma for 10 years and wakes up 
to find that all forms of life have evolved except for him and the whole 
movie its just him getting ripped on for being so lame. He is like a 
batman in a world of supermen. And then everyone gets Rick rolled at the 
end.

2# (TV show) A show about a sloth that solves murders SCI (Sloth Crime 
Investigator) He takes a really long time to solve crimes but he can talk 
and really you only need one murder a season.

3# (commercial) this is for Cup of Noodles. Some people sitting around 
playing video games and ones like I am hungry how about you guys and they 
are all like yeah. So he goes to the kitchen and boils some water and 
brings back Cup of noodles and they are all like nom nom nom this is good 
but I am still hungry so they eat 2 more bowls each and are like we are 
still hungry. Then a voice over comes in "cup of noodles more than just 
soup, a waste of money."

Whilst thinking about larger issues, I tried to find the exact location of 
ThinkGeek. I soon arrived at the conclusion that it sits atop a giant 
tortoise. This led naturally to the ponderment of where that tortoise 
sits. Luckily, before such philosophy could turn dangerous, a bengal tiger 
came and ate the tortoise. The moral of the story? Uh ... green's my

Come on people.. Lets at least put this to use :P Copy and paste this and 
add on to this story :) Who knows how F'ed up it will get :) 

"Once upon a time there was a monkey that loved to eat cheese and drink 
bawls... 

while writing Japanese poetry and contemplating the origin of the 
universe. In a particularly intense moment of enlightenment, he realized 
that he was wearing a garter belt and high-heels. He found this puzzling 
because he distinctly remembered donning a pair of overalls and a atraw 
hat earlier in the day. This caused him to further contemplate... 

why the traffic outside all seemed to be frozen in time. Even the exhaust 
of the cars were suspended in air. The monkey scratched his... 

cranium in a perplexed gesture of helplessness peculiar to the primate 
family, and set off down the sidewalk. Unfortunately, he was in Trenton, 
New Jersey and it was 3AM, so before he got too far he was accosted by a 
masked man with a pistol, who demanded his high heels and garter belt from 
him. Undaunted, our fearless simian hero declared... 

himself a coder god and inisisted that the masked man bow before him and 
assert his status as a "1337 h4x0r". Lauging, the masked man drew his 
pistol, and muttering something under his breath about the "damn script 
kiddies taking over" he...
 
Took the Garter Belt and High heels from the monkey and put them on a 
cross dressing transexual man whom then had wild crazy monkey...

What makes ThinkGeek fortunes so special? 

Maybe it's the fact that they are totally random bits of smart thinking 
and cannot be discussed to death. 

Or maybe it's the fact that instead of reading all those insightfull 
replies and flamewars you'd get in a forum, you just have to immagine 
peoples reaction to your statement while you enjoy theirs in return.

So quit demanding a message board and have another fortune instead.

Job Application 
This is an actual job application submitted to a fast-food restaurant. 
NAME: Greg B 
DESIRED POSITION: Reclining. Ha ha. But seriously, whatever's available. 
If I was in a position to be picky, I wouldn't be applying here in the 
first place.

haggle.

LAST POSITION HELD: Target for middle-management hostility. 
SALARY: Less than I'm worth. 
MOST NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT: My incredible collection of stolen pens and

REASON FOR LEAVING: It was lousy. 
HOURS AVAILABLE TO WORK: Any. 
PREFERRED HOURS: 1:30-3:30 p.m., Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL SKILLS?: Yes, but they're better suited to a more 
intimate environment. 
MAY WE CONTACT YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER?: If I had one, would I be here? 
DO YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM LIFTING

winner of the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes. 
DO YOU SMOKE?: Only when set on fire. 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE DOING IN FIVE YEARS?: Living in Bimini with a

with sudden grief, she points the gun at her own head and starts to cry.

The husband shakes his head and stares at his wife in disbelief.  "No,

The blonde chokes, "SHUT UP, YOU'RE NEXT."

told him how happy I was with this operating system and showed him the 
Windows CD. Too my surprise he threw it into my microwave oven and turned 
on the oven. Instantly I got very upset, because the CD had become 
precious to me, but he said: 'Do not worry, it is unharmed.' After a few 
minutes he took the CD out, gave it to me and said: 'Take a close look at 
it.' To my surprise the CD was quite cold to the touch and it seemed to be 
heavier than before. At first I could not see anything, but on the inner 
edge of the central hole I saw a inscription, an inscription finer than 
anything I have ever seen before. The inscription shone piercingly bright, 
and yet remote, as if out of a great depth:

4F6E65204F5320746F2072756C65207468656D20616C6C2C20 4F6E65204F5320746F
2066696E64207468656D2C0D0A4F6E65204F5320746F206272 696E67207468656D20

'I cannot understand the fiery letters,' I said.

'No but I can,' he said. 'The letters are Hex, of an ancient mode, but the 
language is that of Microsoft, which I shall not utter here. But in common 
English this is what it says:'

The new 30 char limit on names meant I could no longer keep my first name 
as "The Grand High Exalted Dave," and due to some remapping of zip codes 
where I work I had to change the zip on the 'ship to' address.  Which 
caused me to re-enter my name to comply with ThinkGeek's lame limit.  Now 
my name on your pack slip is just plain "Dave."  How will the receiving 
people at work know for which Dave the package is?  Before, it was easy as 
there was only one Dave who was "Grand," "High," & "Exalted," but now it 
could be for any old Dave.  Depressing, man, depressing.

Despite your claims concerning the virtual clock (that it has more faces 
than one might count with fingers) one can actually count all the way to 
1,023 (starting with zero, of course) on two standard issue hands, each 
with only four fingers and a single thumb.

One must use binary, or course. Each manual digit is treated as a binary 
digit. (I don't expect much more detail to be needed on that.) If the 
thumbs are not used, each hand makes one convenient 'nibble' (the binary 
representation of a single hex-decimal digit) and the two of them together 
make an eight bit word.

In short, with the participation of the thumb invited, one can count from 
zero to thirty-one on a single hand.

Ta-da. Teach your children to count in binary and make their eventual work 
with computers a more easily understood experience for all.

(You could count even higher if you allow each finger to have more than 
two states, but the values become increasingly difficult to read, and only 
binary really has a useful application.)

Come on people.. Lets at least put this to use :p!= Copy and paste this 
and add on to this story :) Who knows how F'ed up it will get :)

"Once upon a time there was a monkey that loved to eat cheese and drink 
bawls...

while writing Japanese poetry and contemplating the origin of the 
universe. In a particularly intense moment of enlightenment, he realized 
that he was wearing a garter belt and high-heels. He found this puzzling 
because he distinctly remembered donning a pair of overalls and a atraw 
hat earlier in the day. This caused him to further contemplate...

why the traffic outside all seemed to be frozen in time. Even the exhaust 
of the cars were suspended in air. The monkey scratched his...

cranium in a perplexed gesture of helplessness peculiar to the primate 
family, and set off down the sidewalk. Unfortunately, he was in Trenton, 
New Jersey and it was 3AM, so before he got too far he was accosted by a 
masked man with a pistol, who demanded his high heels and garter belt from 
him. Undaunted, our fearless simian hero declared...

himself a coder god and inisisted that the masked man bow before him and 
assert his status as a "1337 h4x0r". Lauging, the masked man drew his 
pistol, and muttering something under his breath about the "damn script 
kiddies taking over" he...

Was then blindsided by several peices of flung poo. As the mask man fell 
to his knees he heard the monkey say, "W00T! You should remember, when 
hunting monkeys two things, one we prefer to be called code monkeys and 
despise the term 'Script Kiddies' and two we travel in packs". Having 
heard that the masked man apologized for his assumption. The monkey then 
demanded that the masked man remove his guise, and discovered that he was 
none other then...

Bill Gates. The monkey picked up the pistol which had just seconds ago 
fallen to the floor and threw it at the coldhearted fiend. The monkey then 
shrieked in savage warcries that Bill Gates must tell him who *really* 
invented miscrosoft and why he wanted the monkey's sexy lingerie. To his 
surprise, Billy boy started weeping tears of misery and said...

If only the world could understand me! <sob> I only want to be loved (and 
richer). I only seek domination of the entire computer industry (and of 
the more kinky variety). At that moment, Billy boy sprang to his feet, 
charged the monkey and pulled out his...

Wang. At seeing the site of Bill Gates' wang the flock of monkey fled to a 
sewer which they used to escape the maniac. But to the dismay of the 
monkeys the sewer was... 

Inhabited by Justin Bieber clones!  Terrified, the monkey crawled into a 
hole in the wall, just in time to escape their deadly "baby, baby, baby" 
cries.  He found himself in a pitch black space, with a tiny dot of light 
in the distance.  A voice called, "Do not be afraid, monkey!  by the power 
of Robot Unicorns, I shall protect you!"  The monkey crawled towards the 
light, and eventually saw...

After letting the monkey pull htrough my hair with his little fingers for 
hours picking the bugs out and eating them I was thinking no way am I 
going to return this little guy to the zoo.  When he finshed, I returned

guess that they have a pretty short memory because he went back to picking 
at mine.

Roast Lamb Shank with Balsamic Vinagrette dressing:

4-6 lb Lamb Shank with bone in ( stop giggling ) 
1 Whole Garlic
1/2 Stick butter ( optional- but, what the hell.. ) 
1 Lemon / Lemon concentrate
Salt & Pepper
Balsamic vinegar
Virgin ( ha! ) Olive oil
*******************************
Use paring knife and poke many holes in lamb shank to the bone.  slice 
cloves of garlic into wedges,  push into holes.( use at least 1 whole 
garlic clove )  

coat shank with 1/2 stick butter,  squeeze juice of one lemon ( or use 
concentrate )  liberally over shank, salt & pepper shank with style.( not 
flair,_ style_ ) 

Roast in preheated oven @ 325 deg. for 35 minutes per lb.. Check with meat 
thermometer, center should be medium / medium- rare. ( hint- touching the 
bone with the thermometer will result in skewed readings <- Bad Thing tm  
) 

Remove lamb from oven and allow to set 10 minutes before carving. ( 
really. 10 minutes ) 

Drizzle lamb slices with balsamic vinagrette dressing ( 1/3  balsamic 
vinegar 2/3  Olive oil ) 

Serves one. ( okay. Four if you share... ) 

Alternate ending :  Remove roast 1/2 way done, finish as per above on BBQ 
grill over mesquite coals... watch for flames, lamb is very rich (  it's 
got a LOTTA fat in it) and you want to put  a drip pan under the shank, 
surround pan by coals,  do NOT put shank directly over coals. Otherwise 
you get a blackened, charred lump of inedible lamb roast and no 
dinner....great pyrotechnics though... if you aren't a BBQ  god- don't try 
this.

Alternate alternate ending- same as above but substitute dried grape vines 
for mesquite charcaol . Or use regular charcoal and add dried grape vine 
clippings soaked in water.

 let me know how you liked it.
