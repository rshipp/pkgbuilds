New version of ndisc6

* 2010-04-24, Package version/release 0.9.9-2

Applied updates kindly sent through by Gillux Ray <gillou.ray@free.fr> -

"I've worked a bit on your ndisc6 package. I wanted to have a working
rdnssd which updates /etc/resolv.conf with the upstream provided merge
hook. But the system paths were wrong (/usr/var, /usr/etc, /usr/var).
I also created a rc.d script to start/stop rdnssd.""
